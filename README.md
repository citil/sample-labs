# sample-labs
Contains sample lab tasks that can be completed by students using the OpenStack Environment. The same labs can be assigned as graded/ungraded assignments to students by instructors.

# Note: 
These labs assume that students already have access to a working OpenStack setup and have at least the bare minimum privileges to create virtual machine instances, private networks, routers and interfaces, and access these machines through the browser (HTML 5 consoles). 

For labs that require special privileges such as ability to assign Floating IPs for accessing the machines from outside the OpenStack environment, we will make a note accordingly under "Lab Environment Pre-requisites" for each lab task.

# Lab Categories
Sample labs are arranged and grouped in folders pertaining to a roughly topical sense. For example "Getting Started with OpenStack" folder provides simple labs and resources to help students get oriented with the environment.

When feasible, the labs are arranged in folders that map to the NICE-CWF top level categories.

A note on file format. The lab documents are all in Microsoft Word format to make it easier for instructors to edit and adapt the files to their needs.
