# sample-labs
Contains sample lab tasks that can be completed by students using the OpenStack Environment. The same labs can be assigned as graded/ungraded assignments to students by instructors.

# Note: 
These labs assume that students already have access to a working OpenStack setup and have at least the bare minimum privileges to create virtual machine instances, private networks, routers and interfaces, and access these machines through the browser (HTML 5 consoles). 

For labs that require special privileges such as ability to assign Floating IPs for accessing the machines from outside the OpenStack environment, we will make a note accordingly under "Lab Environment Pre-requisites" for each lab task.
